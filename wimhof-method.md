# Breathing technique

## About
- Breathe in through the nose
    - Breathe deeply on each inflow
    - More intense "vibration" sensation during breath holds
    - Longer breath holds
    - Uses diaphragm to breathe *by [Wim Hof Breathing: Method, Benefits, and More](https://www.healthline.com/health/wim-hof-method) by healthline*
- Breath out through the mouth
    - Let the breath go naturally on the outflows, don't push the air out
- Swallowing/gulping during breath holds
    - Does not actually cause your body to inhale/exhale
    - Fix
        - Breathe in a full inhale, then let go slowly, avoiding using any force.
    - Potential cause
        - Letting go of too much air on the exhale
        - There is negative air pressure in the lungs and an urge to breathe in.

# Cold exposure

## About
- Cold showers, bath, plunge, and walk or run outside
- Based on weather
    - Run or walk outside in cold weather
    - Cold showers in hot weather

## To research
- Are there benefits starting hot and moving to cold? (Assuming starting with cold is more beneficial)
- Is occasional exposure beneficial, e.g. a few times a week or month compared to daily?
